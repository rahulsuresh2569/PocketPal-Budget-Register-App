# PocketPal : Your Personal Budget Companion

PocketPal is a personal budget management application designed to help users track their income and expenses, offering a clear view of their financial habits. To be honest, I created this mobile app for my grandpa who faced difficulties in managing his expenses manually :) - he used to write down the expenses and used a calculator.  


## üéØ What It Does & Why It's Useful

Many people struggle to keep track of their daily spending, understand where their money goes, and stick to a budget. PocketPal solves this by providing:

*   **Effortless Tracking:** Quickly log your spending and earnings.
*   **Organized Finances:** Use dynamic categories (e.g., "Food", "Transport") and subjects (e.g., "Groceries", "Train Ticket") to see detailed breakdowns.
*   **Clear Overview:** The main entries list acts as your financial dashboard, showing all transactions at a glance.
